# Heart_Disease_Prediction_Notebook
Hi, welcome to my data science capstone project! In this project, I am gonna introduce to you how I create a model to predict heart disease possibility based on current health status. 

## File detail
- Paperwork
  - Final Presentation 
  - Heart Disease Prediction Report
- Jupyter Notebook
  - Heart Disease Prediction Capstone_Part 1 (data precessing, EDA -> generate cleaned dataset)
  - Heart Disease Prediction Capstone_Part 2 (based on cleaned dataset -> machine learnning models, model evaluations)
- Dataset
  - heart_disease_prediction.csv (original dataset, used in notebook part 1)
  - cleaned_dataset.csv (cleaned dataset, used in notebook part 2)
- Requirements (enviornment packages required for this project)
